      I don't think there's a better start to this playlist than Equivalence by melancholists and melodic death metal icons, Insomnium.
The Finnish band managed to take my heart by storm starting with this song. With this type of music you'd expect the song to be extremely pensively sad, but it's quite the contrary as a matter of fact. The song talks about how you must cherish all the little things in life and how even in the deepest of troubles, there's still a light at the end of the tunnel. Finally I just wanted to add how the guitar work in this song was done to perfection, although on this list you'll find even better guitar sounds and players. This album does and will always have a special place in my heart. Mainly for it's guitar work.

    Although the song lyrics talk about a paramedic trying to keep someone alive, the song in reality talks about lonliness and the struggle someone feels going through it. As a person who struggles with lonliness myself I can say that this song had brought me to tears more times than I care to admit. 
    All that I ask from any listener to this song is to just literally let yourself go, ebb and flow in the sea of emotions that you'll feel.`,

    The reason this song is so high on my list is because, The composition value is outstanding for a 'for fun project', that's not to mention that Jorn Lande's voice is simply jaw dropping. So if you like it make sure to check his other work, most notably "river of tears"`,

    The song talks about someone losing someone else.
    For many people it can literally be them losing themselves to life and their thoughts they drown in every day, that's the beautiful thing about this song. It will describe you in some way.
    If you had ever felt like you needed to let out all your frustration with life. This song does it for you, although some people may not like the "screaming" in this song I personally find it to be very descriptive of the very essence of the point for this song.`,

    This is what I keep thinking every time i listen to Doja.
    Aside from the fact that she got one of the best voices in the pop genre. Doja isn't afraid to tackle any taboo subject, hence how much of a success this song was.`,

    piece: `If you heard the first song on this list, Equivalence, you'll notice that this song picks up exactly where Equivalence left off. The song itself talks about going to sleep, either metaphorically or literally. In both cases, the song fits the entire album and as an extension to Equivalence perfectly. With this band you'll find incredible composition and guitar work with vocals that take the death metal genre to new heights.`,

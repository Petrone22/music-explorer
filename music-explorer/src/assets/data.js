    piece: `
      I don't think there's a better start to this playlist than Equivalence by melancholists and melodic death metal icons, Insomnium.
The Finnish band managed to take my heart by storm starting with this song. With this type of music you'd expect the song to be extremely pensively sad, but it's quite the contrary as a matter of fact. The song talks about how you must cherish all the little things in life and how even in the deepest of troubles, there's still a light at the end of the tunnel. Finally I just wanted to add how the guitar work in this song was done to perfection, although on this list you'll find even better guitar sounds and players. This album does and will always have a special place in my heart. Mainly for it's guitar work.

    Although the song lyrics talk about a paramedic trying to keep someone alive, the song in reality talks about lonliness and the struggle someone feels going through it. As a person who struggles with lonliness myself I can say that this song had brought me to tears more times than I care to admit. 
    All that I ask from any listener to this song is to just literally let yourself go, ebb and flow in the sea of emotions that you'll feel.`,

    The reason this song is so high on my list is because, The composition value is outstanding for a 'for fun project', that's not to mention that Jorn Lande's voice is simply jaw dropping. So if you like it make sure to check his other work, most notably "river of tears"`,

    piece: `This track about redemption and forgiveness is a deeply personal song to vocalist James Hetfield. He told The Sun August 2, 2008: "It takes me to another level. If there was any song that I could listen to 100 times in a row that would be it." and by extension it's a deeply personal song to myself as it talks about how you can never forgive anyone for anything until you forgive yourself first. 
    needless to say that this song has one of my favourite guitar solos of all time. Which by now you can see is a reoccurring theme in my music taste.`,

    piece: `Another really hard hitting song that talks about suicide, it describes a man's journey and transition between life and death. It starts slow and light but picks up pace as he's doing the act itself. But near the end, he realizes that he wants to keep on living and fighting, but alas, it was too late. the guitar work in this song captures the storyteller's feelings perfectly throughout the song, to the point that when Kirk Hammett - the guitarist - was making this song, he said that he was thinking of his deepest and saddest memories, which only goes to show how much soul and emotion went into the creation of this masterpiece.`,

    piece: `Much like master of puppets, The end of the line from the extremely underrated "Death Magnetic" album talks about drug abuse and how drugs WILL ruin someone's life sooner than later.
    James Hetfield, the vocalist specified that this song talks about drug abuse in the celebrity scene and how it dominates the background there. 
    The difference between this song and master of puppets is that -in my opinion- this song is more of a new-age metallica type music. That is to say that it's more "electronic" than their old music.`,
